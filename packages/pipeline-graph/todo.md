# TODOs

## Immediate

* [ ] Make sure the typedefs being generated are correct
* [ ] Set up prettier
* [ ] Set up Storybook, move stories from BO codebase
* [ ] See if we still need "publish from dist" functionality, and if so, can we make it work with Lerna?
* [ ] Validate if we can have Blue Ocean using this when published with es6 modules

## Later?

* [ ] Docgen - requires fw work, and the longer we put this off the more detailed standard for docs will be.

# Done

* [X] Move over unit tests from BO codebase
* [X] Fix up gulp dist issue
* [X] Validate / fix up stylesheet compilation
* [X] Clean out any styles / SCSS vars not being used by this code
